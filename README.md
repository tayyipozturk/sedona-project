# Analysis of Road Network via Apache Sedona/Spark

This project presents a scalable, modular, and spatially-aware analysis system for road networks using **Apache Sedona** and **Apache Spark**. It ingests OpenStreetMap-based road graph data in CSV format and applies various geospatial and topological inferences to derive meaningful metrics from the road infrastructure.

## üöÄ Features

- Spatial joins and queries using Apache Sedona
- Edge-level analytics (e.g., bottleneck detection, heatmaps, speed estimation)
- Node-level analysis (e.g., accessibility, intersection scores)
- Topological inference and spatial cross-analysis
- Modular, testable architecture following SOLID principles

```

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Apache Spark and Sedona must be properly set up (see `spark-submit` usage).

## üß™ Running the Project

```bash
spark-submit main.py
```

You can run individual test modules for specific spatial operations:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## üìä Sample Output

- Accessibility heatmaps for nodes
- Bottleneck roads per area
- Speed profile clustering for routes
- Intersection density metrics
- Topological inferences: connectedness, critical nodes
